This project was built based on the instructions at [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations).

This Rails app uses associations between users - (creators and attendees) and events' tables to allow users perform a range of tasks just like Eventbrite

With this application, users can:
1. Sign up and Log in to their accounts
2. Create, view and attend events
3. See upcoming events in the future and events in the past on their dashboard and on the events' index page.
